        Becoming a programmer takes a small bit of intelligence and a LOT of persistence. Writing code every single day
        keeps your brain focused and helps you grasp difficult concepts.

        Long form programming is the most beneficial. Having one 2-hour programming session is infinitely better than 4 30-minute sessions. Much like a Heroku dyno, it takes your brain time "spin up" and "load the code". It might take 15 minutes to get the zone, and by that time, if you're doing a 30-minute session, you only have 15 minutes remaining. If you're doing a 2-hour session, you still have one hour and forty-five minutes of great productivity ahead of you.

        In order to encourage consistent coding, I've build a leaderboard for TeaLeaf Academy. Input your name and
        GitHub username and you'll be added to the leaderboard below. The more you commit, the higher up the leaderboard you'll get!
      %p
        The leaderboard was built using
        =link_to "Foundation Zurb", "http://foundation.zurb.com/"
        and a scraper gem called Nokogiri. It's the same gem that powers Capybara's functional testing. If you're curious about the code, take a look here:
